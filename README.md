# About
This application uses EmberJS to request data from the Reddit API and then format the JSON response and display in the application. Also uses automatic caching through a custom built identity map. 

Finally the application has been pushed to Heroku with a custom git buildpack installing node, nginx & bower dependencies. [Have a look a the demo app.](http://polar-mountain-4869.herokuapp.com/)
